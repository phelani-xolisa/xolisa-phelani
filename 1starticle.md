# A little bit about HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT

![A picture of the paragraph tag](paragraph.png.jpg)

<p> The picture above illustrates how you make a paragraph tag for your website to have a line of paragraphs it should have these opening
and closing tags shown on the picture above. The picture above is the Hyper text markup language code, coding HTML is similar to writing an
 essay as it has an introduction, a body and an conclusion.  </p>

* Hyper text markup language -
<p> Html is the stardand markup language for creating websites, it is the standard structer of a website that includes elements like paragraphs,
headings, links, buttons, and forms. The elements that are used in html tell the browser how the  website should be displayed with all its contents.
 Html elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc. For the code to run the way you 
want it to work, remeber to always put your code inside the opening and closing tags.</p>

* Cascading Style Sheeets - 
<p>Css is the language used to style the html document, css describes how the html elements should be displayed. Separation of formatting and content 
 also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
 speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on
 a mobile device.</p>

* Javascript - 
<p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time 
compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
