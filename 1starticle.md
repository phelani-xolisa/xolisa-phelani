# First time learning software development

<p> My first time learnig software development was in mid year 2017, i had no computer or laptop to use as my platform. my coding platform
was my 32 page book. I wrote my first ( Hello world ) using Mr Pauls laptop, one week passed and Paul gave me his old computer box to
use when am practicing my code. The first language i learned was Hyper text markup language then Cascading Style Sheets was the second one
and javascript.</p>

<p> Learning these three computer languages for developing a website was a bit tricky at first, as sometimes i would forget the code for linking
all of them together. i would go to google to remeber the code and only to find out that i did not put this symbol ( ; ) at the end of my code.
At the end of 2017 i had coded my first website. 2018 i started learning new languaes</p>

<p>Languages like:</p>

* Nodejs
* PHP
* Angular js

<p> The picture above illustrates how you make a paragraph tag for your website to have a beautiful line of paragraphs it should have these opening
and closing tags shown on the picture above. The picture above is the Hyper text markup language code, coding HTML is similar to writing an essay as
  it has an introduction, a body and an conclusion.  </p>

* Hyper text markup language - is the platform for coding all your code in
* Cascading Style Sheeets - is used for putting style on your website, describes how your code in html should look like
* Javascript - is used for making your website response to the users way of using it. it is used for notification suchs as the pop up message
