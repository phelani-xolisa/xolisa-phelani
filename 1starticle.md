# First time learning software development

<p> My first time learnig software development was in mid year 2017, i had no computer or laptop to use as my platform. my coding platform
was my 32 page book. I wrote my first ( Hello world ) using my Mr Pauls laptop, one weeK passed and Paul gave me his old computer boss to
use when am practicing my code. The first language i learnend was Hyper text markup language then Cascading Style Sheets was the second one
and javascript.</p>

<p> Leaning these three computer languages for developing a website was a bit tricky at first, as sometimes i would forget the code for linking
all of them together. i would go to google to remeber the code and only to find out that i did not put this symbol ( ; ) at the end of my code.
At the end of 2017 i had coded my first website. 2018 i started learning new languaes</p>

<p>Languages like:</p>

* Nodejs
* PHP
* Angular js
